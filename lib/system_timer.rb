# Faraday helpfully reminds you to install `system_timer` if you're
# running Ruby 1.8, since Timeout can give unreliable results. We
# can't do this during first-time runs, since there's no C compiler
# available.
#
# To squash the message and stop confusing people, this shim just
# exposes Timeout as SystemTimer. I'm a bad person.
